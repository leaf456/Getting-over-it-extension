# Getting-over-it-extension
A turbowarp packed version of griffpatches port of getting over it, in an extension.

I made this extension a really long time ago so the code is really bad, but feel free to take a look at my spaghetti if you want.
This was originally on the chrome web store but it got taken down for having an "inaccurate description" because the popup.html file is a launcher, not the game itself.
You can add this to chrome manually if you want, you just need to clone the repo, enable dev mode in chrome://extensions and add the files from your local computer.

I never bothered to re-upload it to the chrome webstore because this was made to allow people to play the game during class and I've since realised that people really shouldn't play games during class.
